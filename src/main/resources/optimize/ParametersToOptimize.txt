This file lists all Parameters which will be optimized on base of a ParameterDump.dat file which will
be provided by CC3D after a Model has been executed.


CellTypes are identified by fields "id" and "name". Depending on the name, the CellType will be optimized or not.
Also the type of fields which will be optimized for each CellType will depend on the name of the CellType.
